# fsd_mwwm_mobx_demo

## Setup

- i advise to install corretto-17.0.14 in android studio and set it with
  `flutter config --jdk-dir="$HOME/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/corretto-17.0.14/Contents/Home"`

- if you have adsense account set `adsenseAdClient`, `adsenseAdSlot` [here](https://github.com/altynbek132/fsd_mwwm_mobx_demo/blob/main/lib/shared/config/options.dart#L8-L9) (i could not get adsense ad client, user must verify his website)

- set `admobTestIdentifiers` in AppOptions, it will appear in the console as error on PictureResultScreen
  `I/Ads     (26896): Use RequestConfiguration.Builder().setTestDeviceIds(Arrays.asList("XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX")) to get test ads on this device.`

run build_runner:

```bash
  dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

compile image service:

```bash
  cd _packages/image_service
  dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
  dart compile js "lib/image_service.web.g.dart" -o "../../web/workers/image_service.web.g.dart.js"
```

## Run

```bash
# prod
flutter run lib/main_production.dart
# dev
flutter run lib/main_development.dart
```

## Issues

- android: rate do not work, app must be published
- could not get adsense ad client, user must verify his website

## My `flutter doctor -v`
